# Navigation App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Developed by Thiago Bonfim

## Requirements

You're building an interactive editorial piece about cities around the world, and want to include a navigation component that will allow the reader to learn about a different city.
Create a simple, minimalist navigation bar based on the video example and JSON file provided. Match the design as closely as you can. The navigation bar should have a sliding bar that indicates a selected item, and that bar should resize itself to match the width of the selected item text.
* On resize, the sliding indicator bar should update its position and size to match text.
* Code should be optimized for Safari. Support for other browsers is not necessary.
* Please limit library usage. ES6 and CSS as much as possible. React and SASS are permissible.
* You will have 24 hours to complete the exercise.

### BONUS:
Display the current time of the selected city. You have creative license on how this should look and behave.
